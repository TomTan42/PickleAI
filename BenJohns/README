BEN JOHNS'S BIO
Ben Johns is considered to be the greatest pickleball player of all time. He has been the #1 player in all three divisions for most of the last three years. His dominance includes a 108-match winning streak in singles, with over 80 PPA Titles and more Triple Crowns than any other male in professional pickleball history.

Outside of pickleball, Ben recently finished his studies at the University of Maryland, where he completed a degree in Materials Science & Engineering. His hobbies include traveling, reading, weightlifting, and playing various other sports like spikeball, golf, chess, and table tennis. He is the co-owner of two businesses: Pickleball Getaways (all-inclusive vacations with pickleball instruction) and Pickleball 360 (instructional video subscription service). He also helped develop his signature JOOLA Perseus paddle.

Johns grew up in Laytonsville, Maryland but now resides in Austin, Texas. He is the middle child of seven children. Ben’s brother, Collin, is Ben’s regular doubles partner, and his sister, Hannah Johns, works for the PPA Tour as a sideline reporter.
